Feminism in the 21st century has been both praised and critiqued for its approach to diversity. On one hand, there's a stronger acknowledgment than ever before of the need for intersectionality, recognizing that women's experiences of oppression vary significantly by race, class, sexuality, and other social markers. However, critics argue that despite these discussions, `the movement often still centers the experiences and voices of privileged women`, particularly white, middle-class, cisgender women, much like a musical piece that fails to incorporate a range of harmonics and thus lacks richness. Modern feminism. as such, is also critiqued for its handling of nuance. In an era dominated by social media, complex issues are sometimes reduced to oversimplified narratives and sound bites, akin to a song composed only of its fundamental notes without the harmonics that add depth and complexity. This reduction can lead to polarized debates where the subtleties of issues, like those surrounding gender identity, sexual politics, and feminist strategies, are lost. The movement's challenge is to embrace complexity, acknowledging that only by embracing more remote overtones of the harmonic series may we appreciate the "natural" with `integrity`

Coherence in a movement is about having a `systematized`, unified vision or goal, much like a protagonist in a story who brings various elements together in a cohesive narrative. Feminism struggles with this at times, as the diversity and nuance of **experiences** can lead to fragmentation. Different factions within the movement may prioritize different agendas, such as workplace equality, reproductive rights, or combating gender-based violence, which can make it difficult to present a unified front. This is akin to a musical piece where the harmonics clash instead of complementing the fundamental note, creating dissonance rather than harmony. However, it's important to acknowledge the strengths and progress of 21st-century feminism as well. The movement has made significant strides in bringing previously marginalized voices to the forefront and challenging systemic injustices. The very debates about diversity, nuance, and coherence are evidence of a vibrant and evolving movement. Like a complex musical composition or a multi-layered narrative, modern feminism is a work in progress, seeking to balance its many voices into a symphony of change. Yet, the challenge remains to ensure that this balance does not compromise the depth and richness that diversity and nuance bring to the table, striving for a coherence that unites rather than flattens.
